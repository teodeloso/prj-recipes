    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This easy cheesy lasagna recipe is a simple lasagna that takes about half the effort of traditional versions. 
        I always make extra for leftovers, but the more I cook, the more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried sage</li>
        <li>1 pinch dry basil</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How To Cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; 
            drain excess grease. Stir in olives and water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder, 
            pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a 
            thin layer of ricotta cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce; repeat 
            layering, ending with meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a 
            knife. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10 minutes more.
        </li>
    </ol>
